# GMOD-Procedural_Interpolation
Client side code to interpolate a position value depending on a few constants. 

This could be useful for vehicles, weapon sway, player movement, and various other projects. 
Edit the constants through the c menu properties on the example entity.

If using this demo on a practical project, I recommend removing the net code and initializing the frequency, dampening and undershot values manually. The net code provided is not optimized for server use.
